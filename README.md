# Employee-Productivity-Project Report
The "Employee Productivity Project Report" repository houses a comprehensive project aimed at tracking and assessing the productivity of employees within a company. This data-driven project utilizes various tools and technologies, including Alteryx for data cleaning, SQL for data retrieval, and Tableau for reporting and visualization.


# Project Workflow
**Data Collection:** Gather relevant data from various sources, such as employee records, time-tracking systems, task management tools, or any other relevant data repositories within the company.

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Use Alteryx, a data cleaning and preprocessing tool, to cleanse the data, handle missing values, and ensure data integrity. This step involves tasks such as data deduplication, standardization, and formatting.

**Data Integration:** If data was collected from multiple sources, it was necessary to integrate and consolidate it into a single dataset. Alteryx also helped in merging and joining data from different sources based on common identifiers.

**Data Storage:** The clean and integrated dataset was then stored in a database system, where it could be accessed efficiently for further analysis and reporting. SQL was used to manage and query the database, allowing for easy retrieval of required data subsets.

**Productivity Metrics Calculation:** Using the integrated dataset, various productivity metrics were calculated to assess the performance of each employee. These metrics could include key performance indicators (KPIs) like task completion rates, meeting attendance, sales figures, customer satisfaction ratings, or any other relevant measurements specific to the company's objectives.

**Ranking Employees:** Based on the calculated productivity metrics, the employees were ranked according to their performance. The ranking algorithm might take into account different factors, such as the weightage assigned to each metric or the time period considered for evaluation.

**Tableau Reporting:** To present the productivity report in a visually appealing and interactive manner, Tableau was employed. The ranked employee data and productivity metrics were visualized using various charts, graphs, and dashboards. This facilitated easy comprehension of the data and enabled stakeholders to explore different dimensions of employee productivity.

**Automation and Updates:** Depending on the project requirements, the process could be automated to periodically update the report with fresh data. This could involve scheduling data extraction, cleaning, calculation, and report generation at regular intervals, ensuring that the report remains up-to-date and relevant.

**Note: Sensitive company information on the report is restricted.**
